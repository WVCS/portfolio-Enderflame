I am a cadet in Westview's NJROTC program, with the rank of Seaman<br><br> and having earned the 4.0 GPA stars. I am also taking CIS, a computer class that teaches coding, photoshop, and Microsoft programs. Currently, I am in Integrated II Math and <br><br>Marine Science. I enjoy playing video games and spending time with friends and family. I like to create graphics on the computer and sketch.

    <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;font-size:110%">My skills include, basic HTML, Microsoft Word, speed reading, extesive vocablulary, basic Photoshop, and knowing how to listen. I am fluent in English, and can speak limited <br><br>Cantonese, enough to carry out a conversation. In the future I will be taking Spanish I and II, learning how to read and write in Spanish as well as speak it and carry out limited <br><br>conversation.

      <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;font-size:110%">I am patient, hard working, determineded, motivated, quiet, loyal, and kind. But I can also be stubborn and a bit hotheaded in the belief of my principals. In my response to<br> <br>fear, I usually freeze, or fight back. When stressed, I stutter and can think a little less clearly. I am usually good with animals and know how to read a dog's body language.

        <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;font-size:110%">My work experience so far has been mainly volenteering and community service for events that are local. All my community service has been done through the NJROTC program.<br><br> The community services consist of setting and taking down stuff for events, selling items at consession stands, and helping athletes during triathalons.The only volenteering <br><br>has been at the Humane Society, teaching animals to get used to humans. I can do yardwork such as painting, trimming small trees, grass cutting, and pulling weeds. I have <br><br>also been an assistant for a photographer, helping with setup and takedown, as well as holding reflectors and such.
