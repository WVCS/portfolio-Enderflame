  <br>
  <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;"> Hello, my name is Mia Wong. I currently attend Westview High School in Rancho Penesquitos as a Freshman. I am a cadet in Westview's NJROTC program, with the rank of Seaman and having earned <br>the 4.0 GPA stars. I am also taking CIS, a computer class that teaches coding, photoshop, and Microsoft programs. I enjoy playing video games and spending time with friends and family. I like to create <br>graphics on the computer and sketch.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;">My skills include, basic HTML, Microsoft Word, speed reading, extesive vocablulary, basic Photoshop, and determination. I am fluent in English, and can speak limited Cantonese, enough to carry out a<br> conversation. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;">I am pacient, hard working, determineded, motivated, quiet, loyal, and kind. But I can also be stubborn and a bit hotheaded in the belief of my principals. In my response to fear, I usually freeze, or fight <br>back. I am usually good with animals and know how to control dogs.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family:impact;text-align:center;">My work experience so far has been mainly volenteering and community service for events that are local. I can do yardwork such as painting, trimming small trees, grass cutting, and pulling weeds.<br> I have also been an assistant for a photographer, helping with setup and takedown, as well as holding reflectors and such.
